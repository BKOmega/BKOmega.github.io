**What changed**  
- Moved frontend to DMZ Traefik; backends via `*.services.domain.internal` CNAMEs.

**Why**  
- Segmentation, simpler certificate management (DNS-01).

**Outcome**  
- Clean TLS; rate limits added; OCSP stapling handled.

**Next**  
- Document Technitium import strategy and CNAME pitfalls.
